# Amazon Product Recommendation System

##  Overview
This project presents a personalized product recommendation system tailored for Amazonâ€™s extensive product catalog. The system leverages **content-based filtering**, a **partial matching algorithm**, and a **weighted scoring model** to provide relevant product suggestions based on individual user interaction history.

It was developed as part of the **CPTS 575: Data Science** course at **Washington State University**.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: R
- **Framework**: R Markdown
- **Libraries**: dplyr, ggplot2, stringdist, etc.
- **Data**: Amazon product and user interaction datasets
- **Platform**: RStudio

---

##  Methodology

The recommendation engine uses the following approach:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Identifies product relevance based on userâ€™s past actions (views, cart additions, purchases)
- **Partial Matching**: Aligns inconsistent product names using fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance)
- **Weighted Scoring**: Combines popularity, ratings, and discounts using a custom scoring formula

###  Scoring Formula

```
Combined Score = 0.2 Ã— Category Score 
               + 0.5 Ã— Weighted Score 
               + 0.3 Ã— Ratings
```

This ensures a personalized and value-driven recommendation list for each user.

##  Results

- The model achieved an average **recommendation accuracy of 35%**
- Top 5 recommendations were generated per user
- Visualizations and performance metrics validated model effectiveness
